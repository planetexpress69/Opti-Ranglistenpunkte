Ranglistenpunkte
================

A tiny calculator to score regatta results. Currently there are two build targets:

* A - according to the rules of the German Optimist Dinghy Association (DODV) as seen on the dodv.org website.
* B - according to the rules of the opti-mv.de website.


Environments in which to run Ranglistenpunkte
--------------------------------------

Ranglistenpunkte runs on iPhone with iOS 7.0 and above. iOS 6 support is ditched as of commit [78dd9ea](https://github.com/planetexpress69/Opti-Ranglistenpunkte/commit/78dd9ea5d72873093a4d832edc412efa9e9ef25b) in favor of Swift...


Dependencies
--------------------------------------

The network code to load the current scoring list depends on MKNetworkKit - see [here](http://blog.mugunthkumar.com/products/ios-framework-introducing-mknetworkkit/) for more information.

Code to display the ranking list depends on a JSON file at dodv.org - courtesy of [Franke Renkes](mailto:frank@renkes.de).
